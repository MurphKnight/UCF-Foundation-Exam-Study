# UCF-Foundation-Exam-Study
This was some of the code I wrote using posted UCF CS code or mycodeschool (YouTube).

I passed the foundation exam in January 2022 and I am a official student of Computer Science at UCF.

The Foundation Exam at UCF: https://www.cs.ucf.edu/ucf_section/foundation-exam/

Description of the exam:
- Students need to pass this Foundation Exam before they can officially be a Computer Science major
- The goal of the exam was to ensure that every student entering 4000-level Computer Science courses had shown a reasonable level of proficiency in a timed exam setting in fundamental computing topics so that the professors of those courses could teach their courses as planned without needing todo any remediation on topics they expected students to have learned in their earlier course work.
